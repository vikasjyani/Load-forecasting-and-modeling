# The application uses a file-based storage system for all project data,
# as per requirements, and does not utilize a traditional database (e.g., SQL).
# Core data persistence logic is handled by services and utility functions
# interacting directly with the filesystem, primarily within the
# app_settings.PROJECT_DATA_ROOT directory.
